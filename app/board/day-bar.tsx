/**
 * One day's hours as a bar, with any leave struck out of it.
 *
 * The strike is the point. Before it, a day off and a day nobody logged looked
 * identical — an empty track either way — and only one of those means work is
 * missing. Worse on a half day: the bar read full at four hours without ever
 * saying four was the whole of what the day asked for.
 *
 * So the hatched part is the half that was not worked, and the fill sits on the
 * half that was: a morning off pushes the fill to the right-hand side, which is
 * where those hours actually happened. That the fill *moves* is what makes the
 * bar readable at a glance rather than needing the number beside it.
 *
 * The two halves are not equal and the bar does not pretend they are. This
 * workplace runs 09:00–18:00 around lunch, so the morning is three hours
 * against the afternoon's five — `split` is where that boundary falls, and a
 * morning off leaves visibly more track than an afternoon off does.
 *
 * `pct` is already measured against that half's own quota — a half day full of
 * work is 100% — so the fill is scaled into its own share of the track.
 * Overtime past the half runs on and overlaps the hatching, which is exactly
 * what it means.
 *
 * The hatch is an inline gradient rather than a Tailwind arbitrary value: this
 * is the one place in the app that needs it, and a `repeating-linear-gradient`
 * spelled into a class name is a string that silently stops being emitted the
 * day somebody reformats it.
